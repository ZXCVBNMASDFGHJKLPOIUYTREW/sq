2. Find the suppliers who live in the same city.
3. Display details of the part that has maximum cost.

);

CREATE TABLE PART (
    part_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    part_name VARCHAR(100),
    supplier_id INT,
    color VARCHAR(100),
    cost DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (supplier_id) REFERENCES SUPPLIER(supplier_id)
);


//Find the suppliers who live in the same city.

SELECT S1.name, S2.name, S1.city
FROM SUPPLIER S1
JOIN SUPPLIER S2 ON S1.city = S2.city AND S1.supplier_id < S2.supplier_id;


Display details of the part that has maximum cost.

SELECT * FROM PART
WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM PART);


Display all part details belonging to particular supplier.
