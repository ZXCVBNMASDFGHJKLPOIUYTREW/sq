1. Create the following database schema:
	STUDENT (stu_no, name, date_of_birth)
	SUBJECT (sub_code, sub_name)  
	ENROLLMENT (stu_no, sub_code, marks) 
2. Find the name of the student with highest marks.
3. Display names of the students according to their subjects.
4. Create a view to display student name and subject name where marks obtained are above 75.
5. Display records of students where date of birth is null.


Creating the database schema:
CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
    stu_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    date_of_birth DATE
);

CREATE TABLE SUBJECT (
    sub_code INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sub_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE ENROLLMENT (
    stu_no INT,
    sub_code INT,
    marks INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (stu_no) REFERENCES STUDENT(stu_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (sub_code) REFERENCES SUBJECT(sub_code)
);


Finding the name of the student with highest marks:

SELECT TOP 1 S.name, E.marks
FROM STUDENT S
JOIN ENROLLMENT E ON S.stu_no = E.stu_no
ORDER BY E.marks DESC;

 


Display names of the students according to their subjects:

SELECT S.name, SS.sub_name
FROM STUDENT S
JOIN (
    SELECT E.stu_no, S.sub_name
    FROM ENROLLMENT E
    JOIN SUBJECT S ON E.sub_code = S.sub_code
) SS ON S.stu_no = SS.stu_no
ORDER BY SS.sub_name;


Creating a view to display student name and subject name where marks obtained are above 75:

CREATE VIEW top_students AS
SELECT S.name, SS.sub_name
FROM STUDENT S
JOIN (
    SELECT E.stu_no, S.sub_name
    FROM ENROLLMENT E
    JOIN SUBJECT S ON E.sub_code = S.sub_code
    WHERE E.marks > 75
) SS ON S.stu_no = SS.stu_no;


Display records of students where date of birth is null:

SELECT * FROM STUDENT
WHERE date_of_birth IS NULL;
