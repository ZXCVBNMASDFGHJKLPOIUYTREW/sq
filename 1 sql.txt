Here's the SQL code for each of the tasks:

1. Create database schema:

SQL
CREATE TABLE PATIENT (
  Patient_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL,
  gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  doc_id INT NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (doc_id) REFERENCES DOCTOR(Doc_id)
);

CREATE TABLE DOCTOR (
  Doc_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  doc_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  drug_id INT NOT NULL,
  experience INT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (drug_id) REFERENCES DRUGS(Drug_id)
);

CREATE TABLE DRUGS (
  Drug_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  drug_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  price FLOAT NOT NULL,
  expiry_date DATE NOT NULL
);

3. List information of the patients who have visited in the year 2012:

SQL

4. Create a view displaying information of the doctor, patient and the drug that the doctor prescribes based on the patients' age:

SQL
CREATE VIEW patient_doctor_drug AS
SELECT p.name AS patient_name, p.age AS patient_age, d.doc_name AS doctor_name, dr.drug_name AS prescribed_drug
FROM PATIENT p
JOIN DOCTOR d ON p.doc_id = d.Doc_id
JOIN DRUGS dr ON d.drug_id = dr.Drug_id;

5. Display the information of the doctor with the highest experience and lowest experience in terms of years:

SQL
SELECT * FROM DOCTOR
WHERE experience = (SELECT MAX(experience) FROM DOCTOR) OR experience = (SELECT MIN(experience) FROM DOCTOR);
