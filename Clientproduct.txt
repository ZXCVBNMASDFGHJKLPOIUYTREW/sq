Creating the database schema:

CREATE TABLE CLIENT (
    client_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    balance_due DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE PRODUCT (
    prod_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    profit_percentage DECIMAL(5, 2),
    qty_on_hand INT,
    selling_price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE PURCHASE (
    client_no INT,
    prod_no INT,
    qty INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (client_no) REFERENCES CLIENT(client_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (prod_no) REFERENCES PRODUCT(prod_no)
);


Finding the clients who have purchased a product with quantity greater than 15:

1. Create the following database schema:
	CLIENT (client_no, name, city, balance_due)
	PRODUCT (prod_no, profit_percentage, qty_on_hand, selling_price) 
	PURCHASE (client_no, prod_no, qty)
2. Find the clients who have purchased a product with quantity greater than 15.
3. Find all clients who live in ‘Panvel’.
4. Find all products where profit percentage is greater than 50.
5. Create a view that displays client name and number of products purchased by him.


SELECT DISTINCT C.client_no, C.name
FROM CLIENT C
JOIN PURCHASE P ON C.client_no = P.client_no
JOIN PRODUCT PR ON P.prod_no = PR.prod_no
WHERE P.qty > 15;


Finding all clients who live in 'Panvel':

SELECT * FROM CLIENT
WHERE city = 'Panvel';


Finding all products where profit percentage is greater than 50:

SELECT * FROM PRODUCT
WHERE profit_percentage > 50;


Creating a view that displays client name and number of products purchased by him:

CREATE VIEW purchase_summary AS
SELECT C.name, COUNT(P.prod_no) as num_products_purchased
FROM CLIENT C
JOIN PURCHASE P ON C.client_no = P.client_no
GROUP BY C.client_no;
