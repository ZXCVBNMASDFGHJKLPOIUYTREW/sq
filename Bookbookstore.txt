Create the following database schema:
	BOOK (book_id, author, topic, price)
	BOOKSTORE (store_id, city, qtysold)
	STOCK (store_id, book_id, qty_in_stock)
2. Give the details of the book with stock quantity greater than 35.
3. List the book information in descending order of price.
4. Find the book whose author name starts with the letter ‘S’.
5. Implement the default constraint for city 


Create the database schema:

CREATE TABLE BOOK (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    author VARCHAR(100),
    topic VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE BOOKSTORE (
    store_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(100),
    qtysold INT
);

CREATE TABLE STOCK (
    store_id INT,
    book_id INT,
    qty_in_stock INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (store_id) REFERENCES BOOKSTORE(store_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES BOOK(book_id)
);


Display the details of the book with stock quantity greater than 35:

SELECT BOOK.*
FROM BOOK
INNER JOIN STOCK ON BOOK.book_id = STOCK.book_id
WHERE STOCK.qty_in_stock > 35;


List the book information in descending order of price:

SELECT * FROM BOOK
ORDER BY price DESC;


Find the book whose author name starts with the letter ‘S’:

SELECT * FROM BOOK
WHERE author LIKE 'S%';


Implement the default constraint for city:

ALTER TABLE BOOKSTORE
ALTER COLUMN city SET DEFAULT 'NY';
