1.  create a user and grant all permissions to the user.
2.Create the following database schema:
	STUDENT (stu_code, name, subject, prof_code)
3. Insert values into the table and use commit.
4.Add save point after insertion of records and verify save point.
5. Delete any three records in the department table and use rollback.
6. Add constraint primary key and foreign key to the table.
 

1).To create a user and grant all permissions to the user, you can use the following SQL statements:

CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydatabase TO myuser;


2).To create the following database schema, you can use the following SQL statements:

CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
    stu_code INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    subject VARCHAR(100),
    prof_code INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (prof_code) REFERENCES PROFESSOR(prof_code)
);


3).To insert values into the table and use commit, you can use the following SQL statements:

INSERT INTO STUDENT (stu_code, name, subject, prof_code)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Math', 101);

COMMIT;


4).To add a save point after insertion of records and verify the save point, you can use the following SQL statements:

SAVEPOINT mysavepoint;

-- To verify the save point
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT mysavepoint;


5).To delete any three records in the department table and use rollback, you can use the following SQL statements:

DELETE FROM DEPARTMENT WHERE department_id IN (1, 2, 3);

ROLLBACK;


6).To add constraint primary key and foreign key to the table, you can use the following SQL statements:

ALTER TABLE STUDENT
ADD CONSTRAINT student_pk PRIMARY KEY (stu_code);

ALTER TABLE STUDENT
ADD CONSTRAINT student_fk FOREIGN KEY (prof_code) REFERENCES PROFESSOR(prof_code);
