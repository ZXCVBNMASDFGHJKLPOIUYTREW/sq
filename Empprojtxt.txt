Create the tables emp (eno, ename, bdate, title, salary, dno) 
 proj (pno, pname, budget, dno) 
dept (dno, dname, mgreno) 
workson (eno, pno, resp, hours)
2.Write an SQL query that returns the project number and name for projects with a
budget greater than $100,000.
3. Write an SQL query that returns all works on records where hours worked is less than
10 and the responsibility is 'Manager'.
4.Write an SQL query that returns the employees (number and name only) who have a
title of 'EE' or 'SA' and make more than $35,000.
Write an SQL query that returns the employee name, department name, and employee
Title.

Query:

SELECT pno, pname
FROM proj
WHERE budget > 100000;

Query:

SELECT eno, ename, title
FROM emp e
JOIN workson w ON e.eno = w.eno
WHERE w.hours < 10 AND w.resp = 'Manager';

Query:
SELECT eno, ename, title
FROM emp
WHERE (title = 'EE' OR title = 'SA') AND salary > 35000;


Query:
SELECT e.eno, e.ename, d.dname, e.title
FROM emp e
JOIN dept d ON e.dno = d.dno;


Drop Unique Constraints:

ALTER TABLE emp
DROP CONSTRAINT eno_unique,
DROP CONSTRAINT ename_unique;
This will drop t
