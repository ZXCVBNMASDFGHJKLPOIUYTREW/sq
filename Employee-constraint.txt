    Salary INT CHECK(Salary >= 10000),
    DeptId INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptId) REFERENCES Department(DeptId)
);


Creating the Department table:

CREATE TABLE Department (
    DeptId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Dname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);


Displaying all the employees who earn more than the average salary of all the employees in the company:

SELECT *
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employee);


Displaying the fields Eid, Ename, and Dname:

SELECT e.Eid, e.Ename, d.Dname
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.DeptId = d.DeptId;


Sorting the employee table in the descending order of salaries:

SELECT *
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC;


Listing all the job designations in the employee table without repetitions:
SELECT DISTINCT Title
FROM Employee;


Displaying all the employee details Department wise and in the ascending order of their salaries:

SELECT e.Eid, e.Ename, d.Dname, e.Salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.DeptId = d.DeptId
ORDER BY d.Dname ASC, e.Salary ASC;


Displaying all the clerks in DeptId D2:
